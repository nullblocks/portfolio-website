* We will train the ML model with Phishing and non phishing urls having 30 different feature set . 

* Chrome extension will observe the URL / website that we visit . 

* `features.py` will extract all 30 features from URL and ML mode will classify wheather it is phising website or not . 

* If it classify as phishing website then it will warn the user about it .

Top search results are all phishing website which have alterated version of OBS software which have malware , Cyber Security reasearcher found this .Now it have solved  when it came into limelight . 

#### So we impement an ad-blocker using `pi-hole` .

* Pi-hole is great for an organization because it block at DNS level and no need it install on every device . 

* It have dashboard , stastics and we can block different site at DNS level.
