The "Faculty Evaluation System" is a project focused on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze reviews and feedback provided by students regarding faculty members. By employing sentiment analysis, the system categorizes the feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, enabling the generation of comprehensive reports on teaching effectiveness. This project aims to assist educational institutions in identifying the best-performing teachers and addressing areas that require improvement, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of education.
