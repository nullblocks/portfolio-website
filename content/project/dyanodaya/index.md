Imagine a classroom filled with students from different states, each struggling to grasp the English language used in history lessons. Frustration and disinterest fill the room as complex words and sentences fail to make sense to these students. History, once a fascinating subject, becomes a daunting and unappealing challenge for them.

### Architecture 
![architcture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110848103/252864828-a2334aca-7bc8-4ff2-8e00-c3f1dd7c8035.png)

* For now we used the GPT-API and also tried with cohere-API but soon I will try LAAMA INDEX and LANGCHANG model . 

* Also able to upload book and can chat QNA with context of book .which will help student during exam time. 

* The Image related to Subject topic or example is created with [stable diffusion](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) present on hugging face .
